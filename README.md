DELATOR (*lat.* **informer**) is a tool to perform subdomain enumeration and initial reconnaissance through the abusing of certificate transparency (CT) logs. It expands on the original work done by [Sheila A. Berta](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek) with her [CTFR](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr) tool and leverages the speed and power of [Go](https://golang.org/).

![demo](https://github.com/netevert/delator/blob/master/docs/demo.gif)

Using DELATOR is as simple as running:

    ./delator -d facebook.com -s crt

To run DELATOR a domain (_-d_) and search source (_-s_) must always be specified.

DELATOR can also be instructed to resolve any subdomains found, giving a first indication of any live sites:

    ./delator -d facebook.com -s crt -a

DELATOR can also mine subdomains directly from CT logs for storage in a local database:

    ./delator -p

Once subdomains have been pulled from CT logs, queries can be made directly to the local database just by changing the search source from "_crt_" to "_db_":

    ./delator.exe -d starbucks.com -s db
